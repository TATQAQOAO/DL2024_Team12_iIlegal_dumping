# Team12 Project : Detecting illegal dumping of garbage

### Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a computer vision system that analyzes footage recorded by surveillance cameras to detect instances where pedestrians and vehicle drivers illegally dump garbage while on the road. 

The model must be capable of performing detection across various locations and environmental conditions.

The algorithm has two main components:
- 
- 

### DEMO


Person and trash detection

## Installation
The code was tested on 


### Setup with Conda

Create Conda environment and install pytorch.

```bash
conda create -n DID python=3.7
conda activate DID
```

Install torch and matched torchvision from pytorch.org.
The code was tested using torch 1.11.0+cu113 and torchvision==0.12.0
